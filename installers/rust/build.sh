# Cross-build for a specific target (needs the rustup target + a cross linker):
#   ./build.sh x86_64-pc-windows-gnu      # needs: brew install mingw-w64
#   ./build.sh x86_64-unknown-linux-musl  # needs: brew install FiloSottile/musl-cross/musl-cross

# The cleanest path for shipping all three OSes is the GitHub Actions matrix in
# .github/workflows/installer.yml — each runner builds its own native binary.
